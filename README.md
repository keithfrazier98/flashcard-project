# flashcard-project
A react application for creating and studying decks of cards. 


The application passes all of the qualified tests on a local machine, 
but when connecting to qualified the test suite doesnt execute because qualified cannot find
the ionicon package (as it does not have access to the node_modules directory).

The qualified assessment was submitted without the use of icons then they were added again after submission.
